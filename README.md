# top-restaurant-page

This project is for the Javascript course from theodinproject.com

The contents of the restaurant page, the menu list, is uhh... AI generated. Chill chill Mr. Odin! Madam Odin? Let me explain. I did not vibe code, promise. Pinky promise. Cross my heart promise. I did use AI generated images because I'd rather use AI generated images than use images from people without sourcing them. I also indicated in the webpage whether the images are AI generated or not... I may have asked AI to give me a name of the restaurant and the menu list name and descriptions but! But! I did not vibe code. Was that what it was called? Vibe coding? Yes. I did not vibe code since I don't have vibes. Only codes. Promise.
